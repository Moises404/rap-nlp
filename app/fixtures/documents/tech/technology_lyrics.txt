"Nelly",
"I’m like Sprint and Motorola, No service, out of your range"

I don’t do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don’t do too much jogging
Drake

I used to be a baller but now I’m Bill Gaten
Wayne

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn’t picture this
Biggie

Out the country but the BlueBerry still connect
Kanye

I say my bank account is on steroids
Trappin' off my Android

Bill Gates don't dangle diamonds in the face
Of peasants when he Microsoft'n in the place

Emails on iPads don't answer when phone rings

Her poker Facebook, I'd already read it

Give her that iPhone 4, FaceTime

And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron

I don't know nothing 'bout iChat
I work in this iPhone they need an app called iTrap

If God had a iPod, I'd be on his playlist

This is anti-auto-tune, death of the ringtone,
This ain't for iTunes, this ain't for sing-alongs

In the summer a peacoat
My iPhone is jailbroke

Attached to your girl like a .jpeg

Canal Streeting my style, like you internet sharing my files

Frank Sinatra on my Sonos

Fuck hashtags and retweets,
140 characters in these streets

And why god's phone die everytime that I call on him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him?

Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the Block

Would skip you like a spacebar, but I much rather delete
2 Chains

Might crash ya Internet
And I ain’t even into that
When I was talking Instagram
Last thing you wanted was your picture snapped

Shout out to them freshmen,
on Instagram straight flexin

"Deep Blue"
“Put the cellphone down for a while in the night there is something wild.”
