"uncorporate identity",
"disappear",
"Instead, it becomes even more difficult to pinpoint what the organization is.",
"The elusiveness of networked organizations appear to more structurally engage their fundamental abstraction.",
"For example, it has so far been difficult to devise a compelling brand for the European Union, an organization which from its inception as the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) has set out to curb, balance and manage the power of nation-states.",
"This 'power block' is too faceless and distributed to even have a central, singular identity to communicate.",
"Corporations such as Facebook the online social networking plastform, are standards rather than brands",
"They, too, amount to the construction of a corporate identity.",
"Consequently, Facebook's logo can only ever be a rather insufficient account of this.",
"An organization dedicated to terrorism, such as al-Qaeda, may outlast severe counterstrikes with its distributed structure of sparse cells.",
"Even though al-Qaeda obviously does not have a house style, it cannot exist entirely in prison for activities which included helping designing its logo.",
"Al-Qaeda, spreading its influence over much of the unstable areas and 'failed states' of the Middle East and Africa, is a multinational brand without center.",
"Osama bin Laden's rise to prominence mirrors 'the latest phase in the Information Age, the techniques of which he has in his own way proves a master",
"Al-Qaeda's activities thus thrive on the standards of the globalized networked communication whose ideology it rejects",
"The rise of corporate identity and branding as every other organization's business model is a tragicomedy of contemporary design practice.",
"Although every organization conceives of a corporate identity, not every organization is a brand",
"Corporate representation in times of crisis brings about examples which are as hilarious as they are telling",
"One entity which has undergone corporate refurbishment is the nation state",
"In line with the valuable obsecations Wally Olins made about the ways in which corporations and states have assumed each other's roles",
"Uncorporate Identity notes how they act out an equilibrium, or even, a costume drama.",
"With the financial crisis in mind, we however arrive at a different conclusion refarding the legitimacy of this balancing act.",
"Consequently, in geopolitical terms, the idea of 'public diplomacy' and nation branding as promoting a state's unique qualities and values, is only effective as long as it comes down to setting stadards for others.",
"The model of the US as an empire deploying 'soft power' cannot be appropriated by ever state, and the rebalancing of American power with other actors calls on us to consider 'network ppower' - rather than 'soft power' - as the main push and pull force international politics today.",
"All such forms of power, this book argues, are matters of design.",
"Design and politics",
"Both the projection of power and the assumption of an image are ways to create a world and make it seem inevitable.",
"The conjuntion of the visible and speakable, the exhaustive self-reflexivity of every moment of aesthetic or commercial solicitation, results in both a hyper-visibility and total indiscernibility for contemporary design.",
"The valorization of design as observed in the 1990s and in the New Economy, with architecture joining in, is sublimated into tvalorization at large, whether it is proper development or social self-branding online.",
"All these fields tend to become subsumed under the paradigm of creativity.",
"As Yann Moulier Boutang observes, artistic creation 'furnishes a self-regenerating resource.",
"The form of exchange becomes the substance of value and the goods exchanged are the empty form of value.",

Ratched PHD
Yung Dada

"Anything that operates with intangible qualities to create value is also creating a world where that value can pursue happiness.",
"Every lie creates a parallel world.",
"The world in which it is true",
"as Momus claims",
"The cultural centrality of design means that its critical and affirmative functions become harder to keep apart.",
"This tendency can be glimpsed via an expansive role for design, analogous to the emergence of conceptualism in art, when the borders between art and other social practices became porous.",
"Design is intensely present, whether commercial or hypothetical, in a way that render the idea of externality academic, and any form/content division obsolete.",
"As the anthropologist Michael Taussig notes in chapter 3, iconoclasm may be not so much a case of subverting a steadfast and moral image, but the bringing to the surface of a latent vice that was always there.",
"This need not be a violent or singular act.",
"Architect Pier Vittorio Aureli maintains that 'it is not a matter of instigating enmity, but to define what could be the possibilities of enmity.'",
"Rather than the defamatory impulse of critique, defacement operates by showing that nothing can be hidden except in plain sight.",
"It is design's role in the projection of what is plain sight that amplifies its potential.",
"Are there any emergency exits on the world political map?",
"The state, as a corporate entity, may be legal disclaimer and an ideal vehicle for hidden agendas.",
"The case studies examined here are the Principality of Sealand, a mini-state in the North Sea near the coast of Essex, and Transdniestria, a breakaway region between Moldova and Ukraine.",
"These examples share a certain lack of credibility in deploying the State 'format' with its set of corresponding symbols.",
"There is room for the argument that the duality of state and corporation, central power and network, is one of balance and coordination, rather than pure difference.",
"Each is free to use the other's name as a pretext.",
"Chapter 2",
"This chapter looks at large buildings and their political message.",
"Two example, the People's Palace in Bucharest, and the Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, lead the way.",
"Both are, in their own way, three-dimensional logos beyond demolition, occupying a particular role within geopolitical information space.",
"They have become prime assets in a (positive or negative) branding of their host cities and countries.",
"Romania as a EU memeber under precarious pradafication, North Korea as the insovent Darth Vader of totalitarianism.",
"Beyond the typologies of museum and monument, the discussion leads to the generic capacity of architectural form to divide space into categories.",
"Architecture is space to be contested in conflict, even it its building is 'network architecture.'",
"Chapter 2 seeks to reconcile the neoliberal idea of 'broadcastin architecture' with political idea of contestation over a common space.",
"It argues that inventive re-occupation may make large buildings more effective as icons.",
"Chapter 3",
"Chapter 3 highlights a capacity of global terrorism: to produce contradiction and mystery within the media, inciting general paranoia about images.",
"Netwar, the type of conflict toyed with by terrorist networks and propaganda agencies alike, proliferates a distrust in the visible, and the incessant desire to unmask.",
"In avoiding the depiction of ubiquities such as Osama bin Laden, George W. Bush, or the Twin Towers, we hope to shift attention to a secondary regime of sneakier, sometimes funnier, visual legacies.",
"This chapter also has a science fiction narrative set in London, and analysis of black metal music with its illegible logotypes, trying to arrive at cultural and political extremes from the fringes of the Scandanavian welfare state.",
"Chapter 3.5",
"The border of the European Union is a heavily guarded edifice which, however, many Europeans don't think about that much.",
"In contrast to the EU's self-styled image of openness and diversity, in African countries Europe promotes itself as a highly unpleasant and dangerous place to travel to and to be in.",
"Chapter 3.5 involves sunny tourist brands, and surveillance footage from Ceuta, one of Spain's enclaves in Morocco at the EU's border.",
"It also has an interview about the construction of European identity.",
"Such an identity cannot exist when it is brought to an artificial standstill, and the provocative, if slightly mysterious, conclusion of this chapter is that freezin an identity equals losing it.",
"Chapter 4",
"Branded states are more than just the postmodern marriage between image management and governance.",
"They present a shift in geopolitics towards standardization",
"The fourth chapter opens with an essay on this topic",
"Further on, via a provocative forecast of urban conditions in wealthy European cities under the economic downturn, a new type of state brand is outlined in which social networking and governance fucntion together - self-management being one future scenario for social democracy",
"Interviews, analysis and speculation on the sheikhs in Dubai, languages and protocols, markets, networks, and democracy in Europe , lead up to this chapter's final essay, which explores the EU as a distributed, rather than a centralized brand - including various historical examples of how the 'abstraction' of the common European organizational space has been dealt with since the 1950s",
"design and speculation",
"a design approach deploying speculation and hypothesis as part of its method is putting a lot of weight on the conceptual, and, ostensibly , political, implications of such phenomena",
"In addition, it runs the constant risk of making wrong guesses",
"So a paramount queestion is what type of inquiry gets to 'inform' the speculative design process'",
"Field notes, interviews, dialogues, theoretical background checks, may all be viable forms of information but the most important aspect that design brings with it is an aesthetic sensibility - it being an antenna and a toolbox for the forms that manifest themselves in our world",
"A design methodology deploying the speculative and hypothetical is taking some advantage of the dissolution of disciplinary boundaries, while also raising a question about where design belongs, when this dissolution tends to produce a more flexible approach to servicing the needs of 'image capital'",
"We believe that speculative design, operating beyond the notion of 'critical practice', can serve as a tool of both analysis and creative action, outlining scenarios and potential approaches in what appears as an incresingly dicey world",
"When 'criticality' is compulsory, design can become doubly trapped - either in the functionality of marketing or the marketing critique",
"Speculative design then, like speculative fiction ('science fiction') risks its status - or whatever is left of it - in order to engage",

"Extreme Laissez-Faire",
"The Principality of Sealand is a man-made island in the North Sea",
"Formerly a defense fortress in World War II, this tower, standing some six miles off the British coast, is a kind of emergency building, a favela of the High Seas",
"The eye meets a joyless, rusty structure that is nevertheless inhabited",
"During the 1960s, this fortress and a few others in the area were in use as pirate radio stations",
"All of them were abandoned and destroyed, except one: Roughs Tower",
"There operated radio amateur Paddy Roy Bates, an ex-major in the the British Army",
"He was about to embark on an endeavor that would get him what money couldn't buy: fame",
"In 1967 he proclaimed the abandoned war platform, located in international waters, his own Principality, a sovereign country named Sealand",
"Bates and his son Michael became princes, and his wife Joan a princess",
"Bates claimed complete independence from the United Kingdom; UK laws did not apply to Sealand territory",
"A blurred photocopy allegedly produced by the British tax authorities (and available on the internet) states that while on Sealand, Bates doesn't need to pay UK taxes",
"The name 'Sealand' imagination, the platform is to be sonsidered 'land.'",
"Thomas More and Mumm, Sealand Model",
"27",
"As much as Sealand seeks to liberate its citizens physically, they can do only very little with that freedom",
"Life on the platform is limited to a security guard named Colin, an ex-marine who has lived on the platform for over 20 years",
"Effectively, he emigrated to Sealand",
"What else is Sealans but a prison in the name of freedom?",
"Its shady entrepreneurial escapades have helped it carve out a presence in the contemporary world",
"TO the ourside world, and to the rulers of Sealand, its continued existence turned this 'desert island' intro a model, a prototype of an experiemntal political entity (an ImagiNation)",
"Through its existence as an image and a projection screen, Sealand has realized for itself the most radical and most fictious, condition of brand",
"29",
"friends of friends",
"the 'mutual recognition' of states as described by the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States excludes entities that have not yet achieved or have been refused soverignty",
"The Montevideo Convention designates when and how a state is recognized.",
"A state should have a permanent polulation, a defined territory and a government.",
"It should have a permanent population, a defined territory and a government.",
"It should have the capacity to establish relations with other states, requireing mutual recognition.",
"This is chicken or egg question - was there first a state or its recognition by another state?",
"While Prince Roy and his allied were struggling to set up business, a successful venture at counterfeiting Sealand passports was launched in Spain.",
"Carrying a Sealand passport, at least in the 1970s, one could travel to various destinations without too many annoying questions asked at the border; in the mid-1990s, apparently, Sealand passports were still wanted in places as disparate as Slovenia adn Hong Kong.",
"'Spanish' Sealans exclusively catered to business people as a target audience, providing them with an affordable key pass to 'emerging markets.'",
"In 1997, after the murder of fashion designer Gianni Versace, a fake Sealand passport surfaced in possession of the murderer's landlord, who then, as a Sealand representative, claimed diplomatic immunity from further prosecution.",
"principality.com",
"A deal was signed between Sealand and an internet startup business called HavenCo.",
"The year is 2000.",
"Hopes were to turn Sealands in an offshore data haven",
"Beyond the reach of authorities, Sealand would host whatever illegal, forbidden or risky information, especially with regard to copyrights and intellectual property",
"Interested actors were expected to pay good money for these services",
"Committed to radically libertarian ideas, a group of hackers - including such 'cypherpunks' as Sean Hastings and Ryan Lackey - had come to Sealand and convinced Prince Roy and his son Michael that their project could bring skyrocketing revenues to the dotcom principality",
"A venture capitalist got involved",
"The data haven started, and Lackey set up base camp on the Sealand platform",
"Sealand began to sumpathize with the Tibetan government in exile",
"maybe the would like some free web space to generate mutually beneficial brand value?",
"A massively popular 'peer to peer' file exchange platform called Napster reportedly sough refuge on Sealand too.",
"Then the dotcom bubble burst",
"The dream team fell apart",
"Sealand and HavenCo's founders split over quarrels",
"HavenCo became a state-owned enterprise with Prince Michael as a CEO",
"The company's web site has since gone offline",
"Click here to buy",
"In Summer of 2006, a fire devasted much of the physical architecture of the world's smallest nation",
"Now, after being founded, having flourished and having faltered, Sealand joins other states in entering a next - possibly final - stage: it puts itself on sale",
"On eBay",
"What can be learned from an English joke?",
"First there were tax havens mini-states and micro0monarchies of old-style geopolitical design",
"Sealand wanted to be one",
"Now, quasi-states and geopolitical black holes frequently appear on the pages of Foregin Affairs and the Economist",
"The state gets seized by its immaterial marketing assets, its practices concelead by the credibility of corporate identity",
"gatekeeping",
"Sealand is the most tangigle architectural residueof the neo avantgardes",
"Archigram loves the Channel fortresses",
"And as Constant invented New Babylon, a superstructural city-state, he devoted it to a society 'liberated' form the trouble of labor",
"Set free from politics, from power, the inhabitants of New Babylon would live playfully ever after in ther suspended world",
"The freedom of Sealand's nationals - whose noble titles may be purchased on line - dressed in the trademarks of monarchy",
"Roy Bates wanted the most primitive type of government for the most advanced type of state, claiming a history that wasn't there",
"Sealand became the carrier for other people's dreams",
"Hackers and designers became its ghostwriters",
"Lawyers and bankers its gatekeepers",
"Atlatis in Coronation Street",
"The poor man's Monaco",
"A free state' and 'temporary autonomous zone' - shorouded in deliberately nebulous promise",
"Heraldry",
"Exploring the tension between the stable appearances of sovereign government (crest and coins), and the low resolution chaos of internet images when entering 'Sealand' as a query into the search engine, Sealand's identity becomes entirely composed of the viewer's preconceptions - an inside formed by an outside",
"Corporations fabricate their own fictions",
"Think of 'environmentally responsible' annual reports and corporate mission statements",
"Taking control over a corporate brand image is taking control over the process of being branded by others - 'coherence'",
"Sealand's brand departs from this idea of control",
"Sealand is continously being branded by what other think it might be - like a wasted celebrity",
"Why waste time trying to discover the truth, when you can so easily create it?",
"The internet is Sealand's unauthrizes biography.",
"A tale of invasions, hijackings, abductions and forged passports",
"A tale of misunderstandings, allegations and rectifications",
"Ultimately, a legend",
"The internet employs a new form of information: 'hypothetical truth'",
"What is told is not so much the truth, as what might be true by speculation",
"With Sealand, this becomes conspicuous because there is no official history (or: a lack of 'brand mangement') refute the organic stream of consciousness in speculations about Sealand",
"Hypothetical truth is playing a paramount role in international politics as governments turn to mythmaking to justify their actions",
"Perhaps speculation always has been important but never on such a systematic scale",
"The British intelligence report on Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' cited a student's thesis found on the internet as supporting evidence",
"It 'self-respecting' governments turn to Googling for the back of future plans, then Google is the modern-day oracle, a gambling machine of hypothetical truths.",
"the fact that flows of information and information management are so vital to the creation of modern myths recals the iconographies and heraldries of nations and nobility",
"Heraldic elements found on national coats of arms are visual representations of mth - for example, dragons are realities in nations crests even if we know they don't exist.",
"In the new definition of nation identity, Sealand- style, infromation takes on the role od the dragon",
"shadow",
"52",
"the political meaning of Sealand would increase if the existence of the island was to be just forgotten",
"If Sealand would contribute to its own vanishing off the map, instead of solidifying its appearance, a new geopolitical terrain vague could appear",
"For example, the shape of stealth aircrafts is designed to avoid radar detection - the form of the plane is more related to its informational imporint on a radar screen than to its aerodynamics in a wind tunnel",
"The appearance of objects in information society consequently is no longer primarily visual, but informational",
"The informational impring of a bran - or the lac thereof  - provides a new paradigm for its management",
"Sealand could be a mode (a construction) without crest, logo, or identity",
"Something implicitly stated",
"Made form trash and everyday objects with no particular meaning, models which obsessively center on its particular shape - like the Devil's Mountain in Close Encounters of the Third Kind - could signify 'Sealand' to those who know how to read the signs",
"Sealand could be a shadow",
"54",
"Sealand cliams the color grey as a national color",
"The color of information networks",
"The color of the cloudy sky above, the color of the surrounding North Sea",
"The color of computer suits, the color of the brain, the color of concrete",

"The rise and fall of the data haven",
"Interview with Sean Hashtings",
"62",
"Hacker and off-shore data storage tycoon Sean Hastings offers a genesis of Sealand's brief incarnation as HavenCo during the 'new economy' bubble and his political philosophy on what self-proclaimed nation states and internet start-ups have in common (they are both the last outposts of freedom)",
"Metahaven",
"When living on the Carribbean island of Anguilla you worked on computer systems for internet casinos and sports books run from various Caribbean and Latin American countries",
"YOu and your wife had chosen Anguilla in part because a friend had said it was a good place to go to get away from government interference - as your web site states",
"Do you wish to start your own government?",
"Sean Hastings",
"The world needs a frontier",
"Every link for good or ill, is an imposition or freedom",
"The frontier has always in a place for people who disagree with the morality of current law to file it away and get away with it",
"It is a place where people who are willing to enchange safety for freedom can try new ways of doing things",
"As long as such a place exists, it puts pressure on existing governments to allow more freedom in their people",
"This means that there is definately a value in such a place, but  then a better would be the creation of a method of lowering the barrier to entry and the cost of changing providers",
"For current thoughts on this, check the Seasteading Institute",
"Thissite was created by Patri Friedman vased on the ideas that he and I and a couple of other people have been bouncing around over the past couple of years",
"Sealand has long searched for a successful business model to exploit its unique geographical and legal position",
"This opportunity seemed to have finally arrived when it became a data haven",
"Many different people claim to have masterminded this",
"Both you and your wide, Jo Hastings, as well as Ryan Lackey and internet activist Bii Scannell, are noted to have played import roles",
"Who did that?",
"The idea to make Sealand into a data haven originated in conversations between myself, my wife Jo, and Vince Cate while we were all living in Anguilla, and before even meeting Ryan",
"We later met Ryan and Sameer Parekh at a financial cryptography conference in Anguilla that Vince was involved in organizing",
"Ryan moved to Anguilla to do some programming about the same time Jo and I decided to return to the USA",
"When Ryan also left Anguilla he was broke and had nowhere to",
"65",
"modus operandi in whic hsecrecy and confidentiality are key",
"A data have - like a tax haven - or any other haven for that matter, must be publicly available to be useful",
"If I have a bunch of disk drives in my sub-basement that no one knows are there and I keep secret data on them",
"that is not a data haven, that is a data vault",
"Teh idea of data haven is a place where anyone can store data freely",
"We were calling ourselves the first data haven for a while, which I believe is accurate, but people kept saying things like 'I've set up dozens of secret data havens - how are you the first?",
"So we switch it to 'first public data haven'",
"Did they fund the haven at any point?",
"They were both investors. Avi actually agreed to take on a more active role, but was usually too busy with other projects to get anything done",
"are there other people or parties who were interested, and decided to, or not to, invest in the venture?",
"Avi and Joi were OK with their onvolvement being public - I do not remember for sure if anyone else was, so I am not going to answer that question, but there were other investors",
"When you state: 'I knw that there were enough people out there with a lot of money who felt the way I do about governments to make this possible",
"I knw that the technology was there to leverage even the tiniest patch of free ground into a great freedom for everyone",
"are you referring to Friedman and Ito or to other potential investors?",
"General possible investors - I had no one specifically in mind at that point",
"And, perhaps as important, how do you value the idea of freedom as such?",
"Free data flow is one of the corner stones of freedom",
"The data haven concept was an effort to strike a blow for free communications",
"Has the validity of such a free ground been put to the test by HavenCo/Sealand venture?",
"I'm not sure",
"It is an ongoing battle - not a testable proposition",
"There will alway be people who see ways to profit by restricting freedom, and there will always be people who will be convinced that forcing restrictions on others can be justified somehow",
"What about the force of arms?",
"If you have physical presence at a know location, then you cannot have liberty without force of arms",
"If no one know where you are, or your system is so distributed as to be intangible, then weapons are not required",
"Are you someone who spells 'internet' with a capital 'I'",
"Only because my spell checker makes me",
"I have never been someone who treats the internet as a new universe - or buys into a cyberspace metaphor",
"To me the internet is just the next step from the telegraph and the telephone - it is na exponential",
"Internet stocks, and I stopped being involved",
"But I might be overwighing the importance of item two",
